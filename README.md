Integral_motivic_decomposition.py is a Sage script that contains necessary functions to compute decompositions of Chow motives of versal homogeneous spaces with integer coefficients. 

IntegralG2analysis.py is a script that applies these functions to find motivic decomposition of verasl form of $G_2/P_1$ into 3 indecomposable parts that correspond to shifts of Rost Motive. Reducing modulo $p=2$ this agrees with known computatuions of motivic decomposition of the motive with $F_p$-coefficients.
